WinRod

v. 1.84
There is a long list of bug fixes and corrections.
In this version:
- is possible to save curves and data from 2d graphs
- in 3D lasso selection an error responsible for instability is removed
- the transform matrix for 3D view is extended for all crystallographics systems monoclinic and threeclininc
- There is also extension to the rughness modeling for multilayers. This one needs more explanation but really well
